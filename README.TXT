This project was created to test my abilities
with a mongodb backend, using next js and mongodb 
I was able to create a blog website that takes in user 
input from a "secret" page which I have provided to those intended 
to use this site.

Core functionality: 
To send POST requests to my mongodb server after a form is filled out with the title and content of the blog post 
Receive information through GET Request to the database after user goes back to the home page.
